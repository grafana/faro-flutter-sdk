# Grafana Faro Protocol Overview

## What is Grafana Faro?

Grafana Faro is an observability protocol designed by Grafana Labs for frontend and mobile application monitoring. It provides a standardized way to collect, process, and visualize application telemetry data.

## Key Concepts

### Data Types

Faro handles several types of telemetry data:

- **Logs**: Application logs and messages
- **Exceptions**: Error and exception data
- **Measurements**: Performance metrics like CPU, memory usage
- **Events**: User interactions and application lifecycle events
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing information

### Metadata

Each telemetry message includes metadata about:

- Application (name, version, environment)
- Session information
- Device characteristics
- User information (when available)

### Transport

The protocol defines how data is:

- Batched for efficiency
- Formatted (typically JSON)
- Sent to Grafana Cloud endpoints

## Integration with Grafana Ecosystem

Faro connects with:

- **Grafana Alloy**: For processing and routing telemetry data
- **Grafana Cloud**: For storage and visualization
- **Grafana Dashboards**: For analyzing application performance

## Benefits for Flutter Applications

- **Unified Observability**: Single protocol for different telemetry types
- **Lightweight**: Designed for mobile environments
- **Privacy-focused**: Controls for sensitive data
- **Complete Picture**: Combines frontend and backend monitoring

## Implementation in this SDK

This Flutter SDK implements:

1. Data collection matching Faro specifications
2. Proper metadata enrichment
3. Efficient batching and transport
4. Integration with Flutter's widget and HTTP lifecycle
