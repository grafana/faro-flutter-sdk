## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed

- **SDK name consistency across telemetry types**: Updated SDK identification to use consistent naming

  - Changed hardcoded 'rum-flutter' SDK name to use `FaroConstants.sdkName` for consistency with OpenTelemetry traces
  - Maintains backend-compatible version '1.3.5' for proper web SDK version validation
  - Added actual Faro Flutter SDK version to session attributes as 'faro_sdk_version' for tracking real SDK version

- **FaroZoneSpanManager span status preservation**: Fixed issue where manually set span statuses were overridden by automatic status setting
  - Added `statusHasBeenSet` property to `Span` interface to track when status has been manually set
  - Updated `FaroZoneSpanManager.executeWithSpan()` to respect manually set span statuses for both success and error cases
  - Prevents overriding of custom span statuses (e.g., business logic errors) when code executes without throwing exceptions
  - Maintains existing behavior for spans that haven't had their status manually set
  - Resolves issue #86: FaroZoneSpanManager overrides manually set span statuses on success

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-02 ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Package structure refactoring to follow Flutter plugin conventions**: Reorganized the package to align with Flutter/Dart ecosystem standards and best practices

  - **Breaking Change**: Main entry point changed from `faro_sdk.dart` to `faro.dart`

    - The package now follows the standard `lib/<package_name>.dart` convention
    - Removed `lib/faro_sdk.dart` file entirely
    - `lib/faro.dart` is now the single main entry point with selective barrel exports

  - **Migration**: Update your imports to use the new main entry point

    ```dart
    // Before
    import 'package:faro/faro_sdk.dart';

    // After
    import 'package:faro/faro.dart';
    ```

  - **Architecture Improvements**:

    - Moved core `Faro` class implementation from `lib/faro.dart` to `lib/src/faro.dart`
    - `lib/faro.dart` now serves as a clean barrel export file exposing only public APIs
    - All implementation details properly organized under `lib/src/` directory
    - Clear separation between public API surface and private implementation
    - Follows established Flutter ecosystem conventions used by popular packages like Provider, BLoC, and Dio

  - **Benefits**:

    - **Cleaner API boundaries**: Clear distinction between public and private APIs
    - **Better maintainability**: Implementation details can evolve without affecting public interface
    - **Consistent developer experience**: Matches patterns developers expect from other Flutter packages
    - **Future-proof**: Enables easier API evolution and versioning
    - **Community alignment**: Follows official Flutter/Dart documentation recommendations

  - **No functionality changes**: All existing public APIs remain the same, only import paths have changed

### Added

- **Type-Safe Log Level API**: New `LogLevel` enum for improved logging reliability and developer experience

  - Introduced `LogLevel` enum with values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `log`, `warn`, `error`
  - Aligns with Grafana Faro Web SDK for cross-platform consistency
  - Includes `fromString()` method for backward compatibility, supporting both `'warn'` and `'warning'` variants

- **Enhanced Tracing and Span API**: Major improvements to distributed tracing capabilities

  - New `startSpan<T>()` method for automatic span lifecycle management with callback-based execution
  - New `startSpanManual()` method for manual span lifecycle management when precise control is needed
  - New `getActiveSpan()` method to access the currently active span from anywhere in the execution context
  - Zone-based span context management ensures proper parent-child relationships across async boundaries
  - Automatic session ID injection - all spans now include both `session_id` and `session.id` attributes
  - Improved error handling with automatic span status updates when exceptions occur
  - Enhanced span status tracking with proper OpenTelemetry status code mapping
  - Support for custom parent span specification to create explicit span hierarchies
  - Comprehensive documentation with detailed examples for common tracing patterns

- **Centralized Session Management**: New `SessionIdProvider` for consistent session handling across the SDK

  - Dedicated session ID generation and management
  - Better integration with tracing system for session context propagation
  - Factory pattern for testable session management

- **SDK Constants Management**: New centralized constants system

  - Added `FaroConstants` class for SDK version and name management
  - Better version tracking and consistency across the codebase

- **BREAKING: Synchronous API for telemetry methods**: Refactored telemetry methods to remove unnecessary async patterns for improved performance and developer experience

  - **Breaking Change**: The following methods changed from `Future<void>?` to `void`:
    - `pushEvent()` - Send custom events
    - `pushLog()` - Send custom logs
    - `pushError()` - Send custom errors
    - `pushMeasurement()` - Send custom measurements
    - `markEventEnd()` - Mark event completion
  - **Migration**: Remove `await` keywords from calls to these methods as they are now synchronous

    ```dart
    // Before
    await Faro().pushEvent('event_name');
    await Faro().pushLog('message', level: LogLevel.info);

    // After
    Faro().pushEvent('event_name');
    Faro().pushLog('message', level: LogLevel.info);
    ```

  - **Benefits**:
    - Improved performance by eliminating unnecessary async overhead
    - Cleaner API that better reflects the synchronous nature of these operations
    - Reduced complexity in application code
  - **Internal Architecture**: Introduced `BatchTransportFactory` singleton pattern for better dependency management and testing

- **BREAKING: pushLog API requires LogLevel enum**: Enhanced logging API for better type safety and consistency

  - **Breaking Change**: `pushLog()` now requires a `LogLevel` parameter instead of optional `String?`
  - **Migration**: Replace `level: "warn"` with `level: LogLevel.warn` in your pushLog calls
  - **Benefit**: Eliminates typos in log levels and provides better IDE support
  - **Compatibility**: Existing string-based log levels in internal code updated to use LogLevel enum
  - **Documentation**: All examples and documentation updated to reflect the new API

- **Tracing Architecture Refactoring**: Complete redesign of the internal tracing system

  - Replaced legacy `tracer.dart` and `tracer_provider.dart` with new `FaroTracer` implementation
  - New `FaroZoneSpanManager` for robust zone-based span context management
  - Improved `Span` class with cleaner API and better OpenTelemetry integration
  - Enhanced span creation and management with proper resource attribution
  - Better separation of concerns between tracing components
  - Zone-based implementation ensures proper parent-child relationships across async boundaries
  - Enhanced developer experience with multiple tracing approaches for different use cases
  - Better integration between tracing and other SDK components

- **Session Management**: Extracted session logic from distributed components
  - Removed deprecated `generate_session.dart` utility
  - Centralized session management in dedicated provider
  - Improved testability and maintainability of session-related functionality
